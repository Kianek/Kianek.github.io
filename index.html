    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p class="blurb">
      My name is Keanu, and I am a self-taught full stack web developer based in
      Portland, Oregon. I have experience writing web applications and APIs in
      C#, JavaScript, and Python. I also have experience with front end
      frameworks such as React and Vue.

    <h2>What I Do</h2>
    <p class="blurb">
      My domain is in the realm of business logic. I love brainstorming
      architecture and data/database modeling. The process of iteratively
      designing, implementing, and refactoring a project makes me happy. Doing
      those things well makes me even happier.

    <h2>A Bit About Me</h2>
    <p class="blurb">
      I spend the bulk of my free time learning. I enjoy learning programming
      languages, natural languages, frameworks, studying history, and
      philosophizing. I believe that curiosity is a massively underrated trait,
      and that nuance is golden. I try to communicate clearly and tactfully. I
      believe that people's differences can make things interesting, but it's
      ultimately what we share in common (even if it's only dedication to the
      mission) that makes or breaks a team.
