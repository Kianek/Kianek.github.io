- title: About Me
  body: "I spend the bulk of my free time learning. I enjoy learning programming languages, natural languages, frameworks, studying history, and philosophizing. I believe that curiosity is a massively underrated trait, and that nuance is golden. I try to communicate clearly and tactfully. I believe that people's differences can make things interesting, but it's ultimately what we share in common (even if it's only dedication to the mission) that makes or breaks a team"
